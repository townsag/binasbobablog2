### The Ranking System:
Our goal was to make a ranking system that was both simple and expressive. When divising the ranking system, we chose the four characteristics with the least overlap that also covered the things most important to us: Value, Variety, Atmosphere, and Quality. In practice we found that our ranking system had a hole, in fact every ranking system would have a hole. We added the Wow category to cover any qualities that a boba shop may have that don't fit well into any of the previous categories. We see the categories as mostly independent, so we don't consider a total score of all the categories combigned. This reflects out belief that there is no one best boba shop, but instead many boba shops that do different things well. We hope that each category serves readers with different priorites. Furthermore, we chose 3.5 as the average rating for each category. This is to avoid a situation in which every shop is a 5/5 or every shop is a 3/5 because we only rate the shops using whole numbers.

### Value:
This score can be expressed as (How much we enjoyed it) / (How much we paid for it). Value does not have to mean cheap boba. Tan Cha in Cupertino is a perfect example of expensive boba that has value because we enjoy it so much. That being said, in general cheaper boba tends to have a higher value score. An (unrelated) example of a 5/5 on the value score would be In-n-Out Burger. A double-double provides much more satisfaction that the $5 that I paid for it.

### Variety:
This category is the most important to the reviewers personally, so we may tend to judge it more harshly. Variety means having multiple drink options across multiple categories and a broad selection of toppings. Furthermore, boba shops with high variety scores will also have cafiene free options and drinks unique to their shop. An example of a 5/5 on the variety score would be Pure Tea.

### Atmosphere:
We see atmosphere as all the things in a boba shop that contribute to the way you feel about going there. This includes: the decorations, the way the menu is layed out, the music and volume, and one million other things haha. We like to study at boba tea shops so our idea of a good atmosphere might be very different than yours. An example of a 5/5 on the atmosphere score would be Cafe LaTea in Cupertino. The store is well layed out, it is often busy but the line is never long, the music is great for studying or relaxing, and there is lots of seating. Notably, negative experiences contribute to a lower atmosphere score. For example, Pop Up Tea is gorgeously decorated but it's desceptive pricing leads to a lower atmosphere score.

### Quality:
The Quality score signals how good the boba tea is relative to the category of drinks made by the shop and regardless of how much it costs, although costly boba is not always of higher quality. Also, boba shops make different drinks in different styles, so we try not to compare apples to oranges. An example of a 5/5 on the quality score is Philz coffee. In the category of pour over coffee, they make solid drinks with an emphasis on using quality materials and attention to detail (I am a former Philz barista lol). 

### Wow:
This is the catch all category for all things that don't fit in the other categories, as well as the category for aspects of a boba shop that are unique or make us excited. Examples of wow are: animal fries at In-n-Out, the first time we had tirimisu foam, tiered drinks and drinks that changed color, and black tea with vanilla ice cream.
