## Phin Cafe: The Best Musubi in the Game

Phin Cafe is a lovely little shop that has coffee, boba tea, and food offerings. The consistent quality and lively atmosphere make it one of my favorite places to go for a board game date or a few hours working from (not) home. 

### Value:

Coming soon :)

### Variety:

Unique selection of coffees with flavored cream/foam and a small but diverse selection of tea drinks. They recently stopped carrying egg pudding as a topping choice which is personally disappointing but they have a reasonable selection (boba, crystal boba, lychee jelly, aloe). Food wise, I’ve been eyeing the garlic fries but I haven’t tried much. I do enjoy the egg puff and my partner (Bina’s Boba Boi) has a hard time not ordering a spam misubi (check spelling) when we go. I’d love a decaf black tea option but no place is perfect :)

### Atmosphere:

The shop is well decorated, it has a reasonable amount of seating. It is a feat to snag a table on a crowded Saturday but not impossible. I think it would be crowded if they added more- so I see why they haven’t. But they have a loyal enough customer base I’m optimistic another location might open at some point (or knocking down a wall to make a larger unit!). Staff have never been unfriendly but also aren’t overly chatty and holding up the line, it’s great!

### Quality:

The quality of all offerings has been consistently good. The boba strikes a balance of softness and chew- personally I like my boba a tiny bit softer but that’s really just preference. 

### Wow:

For me the wow factor of Phin Cafe is the combination- quality, decor, atmosphere, and variety. It’s well decorated but not overdone, I don’t have to worry about not knocking anything over or dust collecting on fake plants. They have enough snacks that if I’m hungry I don’t have to decide between boba and food, and the snacks are good enough quality I don’t feel I’m being overcharged purely for convenience.
