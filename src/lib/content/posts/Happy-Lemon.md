## Tried and True: Happy Lemon

I have been coming to this boba tea shop for about five years now. When I worked at a different boba tea shop, Happy Lemon was the go-to spot for playing cards after work.

You may be wondering why we are writing a review of Happy Lemon, the most prolific boba chain in the Bay Area: the blog needs content and this seems like a good place to start ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

### Variety:

Happy Lemon is the benchmark for variety. They have drink options in all the major categories as well as drinks unique to their franchise. We are particularly fond of the mango-matcha smoothie and the yakult drinks. Furthermore, they have an adequite variety of caffine free drinks, something that is very important to us when rating boba shops. The only thing I can think of that would be missing from their menu are those sugar cane drinks. 

### Atmosphere:

Happy Lemon is like most chains in that it's atmosphere is consistent and generic. While it is clear that someone puts a lot of thought into the branding of Happy Lemon, it lacks the character of some independent stores like Phin Cafe or Pop Up Tea. That being said, Happy Lemons atmosphere is very predictably clean. The store gets frequent rushes but they are never overcrowded for long. Finally, I have found that Happy Lemon employees have great taste in EDM.

### Quality:
