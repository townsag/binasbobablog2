## Sinceretea: Enter the **FoAm ZoNe**

We found this boba tea shop on a windy January afternoon after getting tuna from the best poke shop in town: Santo Market. Sinceretea was a very welcome respite from the winter chill. We look forward to visiting Sinceretea again so we may fill out this blog post haha

### Value:

Coming Soon :)

### Variety:

This is the only boba shop I have seen so far with savory egg puff waffles! If you are looking for Bacon n' Cheese egg puffs to dip in your boba, your search is over :D . Aside from the novel egg puff flavors, Sinceretea also has many tea offerings. I appreciate that even though their menu is not as large as some stores, they still have a large variety of drinks and each drink looks good. This includes a couple good decaffinated options too.

### Atmosphere:

This shop felt both comfortable and lively. The bright notes of Luke Chiang coming over the speakers combigned with the afternoon sunlight coming through window provided a good studying atmosphere. I can tell that the Japan Town locals frequent this place for afternoon drinks and snacks. My only lament is that the chairs were kinda hard on my lower back...

### Quality:

Coming Soon :)

### Wow:

We already touched on this in the variety section but savory egg puff waffles really threw us for a loop.
